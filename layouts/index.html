							<p>
								Benjamin Muschko is a thought leader in the realm of Continuous Delivery. Ben delivered the mission critical build infrastructure for generating and publishing application pipelines for my organization. He taught our developers the discipline of "declarative deployments" to eliminate manual mistakes in software delivery. I would absolutely recommend Automated Ascent for businesses who want to take their CI/CD story to the next level.

								Ben has been a trainer and author with Oâ€™Reilly for over 4 years now, and it is no exaggeration to say that among the dozens of highly talented, skilled trainers and authors I have had the privilege to work with, nobody has done any better work. Ben is consistently ahead of schedule, highly professional, and very effective as a trainer. His courses have consistent high attendance, and the attendee feedback for those courses is invariably very positive.
